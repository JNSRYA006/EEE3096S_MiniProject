# EEE3096S_MiniProject
This is the GitHub repository for the Embedded Systems II Mini Project on Light of Things (LOT).
The brief of the project is to create an LOT transmitter and receiver system using two STM32F051R8 Discovery Boards with their on-board LEDs and pushbuttons, and add an external potentiometer circuit to sample a message to be sent over the system, and an LDR (light dependent resistor) circuit to sample the recieved signal. The sampled signals will both be processed through the on-board Analogue to Digital Converters (ADCs).
